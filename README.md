# Code Music

Wanted to see if codes could speak, so I build up with this small code to combine the sound playing and a lexical analyser to create exactly that.

This is most fun I had with a 20 minutes code, so I decided to share it. Try using different values for different sounds.

## Installation

It requires ply which is a python implementation of lex and yacc. Install that from pip

```shell
pip install ply
```

Then you can run it directly.
